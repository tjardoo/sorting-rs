# Sorting in Rust

## Usage

```rs

## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble

Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, until the entire array is sorted.

### Insertion

Insertion sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It works by iterating over the array and inserting each item into its proper position within the already-sorted part of the array.

## Testing

```rs
cargo test
```

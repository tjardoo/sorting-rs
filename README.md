# Sorting in Rust

## Usage

```rs
// todo
```

## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble

Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, until the entire array is sorted.

### Insertion

Insertion sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It works by iterating over the array and inserting each item into its proper position within the already-sorted part of the array.

### Selection

Selection sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and moves it to the front. It works by dividing the input array into two parts: the sorted part at the beginning and the unsorted part at the end.

### Quick

Quicksort is a popular comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array. It works by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the array around the pivot, and recursively sorting the left and right subarrays.

## Testing

```rs
cargo test
